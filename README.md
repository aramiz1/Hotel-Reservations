# Hotel-Reservations

This project is a simple hotel reservations app in java. There are a total of 15 rooms in the hotel, 
with 3 different room types having 5 rooms each.

There is also a secure login page, in which the customer must enter their confirmation ID in order to enter
and access their information.

The class file HotelClass defines an object for each individual customer that stores all of their info. All
of the customer info is stored using serialization/deserialization in the customers.ser file.

The customer can book a room and have access to different features such as changing their room type, paying
their bill...etc.
